This is the existing documentation generated by the Doxygen Documentation Tool (http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html) for the Eagle Eye project.

This documentation is subject to change as the code varies before the completion of the project.

The html folder in this directory contains an index.html file; this is the file that you need to open in order to navigate the generated html pages.

The latex folder in this directory contains a multitude of files and file types. Included in these files are PDFs of the different class diagrams currently defined in the eagle eye system.

This documentation is not meant to act as a replacement for in-code documentation; rather, it is a supplement that is meant to help aide a future team have a better understanding of the codebase.
